# CUDA-MBSO

This project is the code for PhD thesis of Chen Jin @ RMIT University. The thesis title is Scalable Parallel Evolutionary Optimisation based on HPC. This project contains the code for four main chapters (4,5,6 and 7) in each fold. The instruction and guidelines to use the codes of each chapter can be seen at each fold.

## Getting Started

Most codes are executed on HPC system exclude chapter 6. So set the enverinment of HPC is necessary
### Prerequisites

These are all softwares that are used in this project
```
gcc:5.5.0
openMPI:3.0.0
CUDA:8.0
```
The above versions are tested. Other versions of above software may also work on our code, but it is not guaranteed
